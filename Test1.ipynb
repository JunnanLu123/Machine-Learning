    "In this project, we build and train a model to categorize the Iris flower base the sample data. The algorithm we chose to implement for this project is multilayer perceptron. The Iris data set is available from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of information on 150 Iris flowers. We focus on learning three Iris species which are Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The dataset is characterized by five attributes:\n",

    "We designed a Neural Network with very simple structure. The network contain 4 layers which are input, hidden, and output layers. The input layers consists of four nodes. The input for the network is a vector of Iris features which are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. There are two hidden layers with 10 nodes on each of the layers. We chose to use linear function, Relu, as the activation functions. The predicted probability of the Iris class will send to the output layer which represents Iris flower classes. The figure below shows the model Neuro Network."

The neurons from the input layer are connected each neurons in the first hidden layer. The same way applys to second and final output layers. There is a single bias unit that is connected to each neurons in the hidden layers. The neurons in the hidden layers compute the weighted sum from the inputs to form the scalar net activation. We write the equation as in the figure below:"
